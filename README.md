# project-persephone

_"Only Persephone, daughter of Zeus and wife of Hades, could travel between the Underworld and the world of the living. Project Persephone is the liaison between our physical world and the world of the Semantic Web."_

A Clojure library for validating xAPI Statements against xAPI Profiles. 

## Usage 

The `persephone` namespace contains functions that perform two main tasks. The first is to validate Statements against Statement Templates, which is accomplished via these two functions:

- `validate-statement-vs-template`: Taking a compiled Statement Template and a Statement as arguments, validates the Statement against the properties and rules of the Template (as described in the [xAPI Profile spec](https://github.com/adlnet/xapi-profiles/blob/master/xapi-profiles-structure.md#statment-templates)).

- `validate-statement-vs-profile`: Taking a compiled xAPI Profile and a Statement as arguments, validates the Statement against all the Statement Templates of the Profile. The Statement is considered valid for the whole Profile if it is valid for at least one Template.

To compile a Statement Template or Profile for use with these functions, the `template->validator` and `profile->validator` functions are used, respectively.

The other task is to validate streams/collections of Statements against
Patterns, which are compiled into finite-state machines (FSMs). That is accomplished by the following functions:

- `match-statement-vs-pattern`: Taking a compiled Pattern, a map containing the current FSM state info, and a Statement, matches the Statement against that Pattern according to the [xAPI Pattern specification](https://github.com/adlnet/xapi-profiles/blob/master/xapi-profiles-structure.md#patterns) and returns updated state info.

- `match-statement-vs-profile`: Taking a compiled Pattern, a current state info map, and a Statement, matches the Statement against all of the Profile's Patterns and returns updated state info.

To compile a Profile into FSMs, use the `profile->fsms` function. This will return a map between Pattern IDs and compiled Patterns, the latter which can be used in `match-statement-vs-pattern`.

### Validation on Statement Template

Validating a Statement against a Statement Template involves three aspects:

- Validating against Rules. To do so, we need to use the JSONPath given by `location` (and possibly `selector`) to return a set of values from within the Statement and match these values against the `presence`, `any`, `all` and `none` property.

- Validating against Determining Properties (the verb, the object activity  type, and the four context activity types). They can be expressed as rules in which the respective values from the Statement MUST be included and given by the Statement Template.

- Validating against StatementRefs (object and context StatementRefTemplates). These are arrays of StatementTemplate IRIs, which  point to _more_ Statement Templates that we need to validate against in a  recursive manner. These additional Statements are referenced by  StatementRefs in the original Statement. This can potentially require querying this and other Profiles; thus, that aspect of validation is, for now, unimplemented.

The `validate-statement-vs-template` and `validate-statement-vs-profile` functions take the optional argument `:fn-type`, which can be set to the
following:

- `:predicate` - Returns `true` for a valid Statement, `false` otherwise. Default for both functions.

- `:option` - Returns the statement if it's valid, `nil` otherwise. (This is similar to the Option type in OCaml or the Just type in Haskell.)

- `:result` - Returns the validation error data if the Statement is invalid, `nil` otherwise. (This is similar to the Result type in OCaml.)

- `:assertion` - Throws an exception if the Statement is invalid, returns `nil` otherwise.

`validation-statement-vs-template` takes an addition option for `:fn-type`:

- `:printer` - Prints an error message when the Statement is invalid. Always returns `nil`.

`validation-statement-vs-profile` takes an addition option for `:fn-type`:

- `:templates` - Returns a vector of the IDs of the Statement Templates the Statement is valid for.

Both compilation functions, `template->validator` and `profile->validator`, have an additional optional argument: `validate-template?` and `validate-profile?`, respectively. By default they are set to `true`, in which case they validate the syntax of the Template/Profile. Set this to `false` only when you know what you're doing!

The following is an example error message from `validate-statement-vs-template`, when `:fn-type` is set to `:printer`:

```
----- Invalid Statement -----
Statement ID: "fd41c918-b88b-4b20-a0a5-a4c32391aaa0"
Template ID: http://foo.org/example/template

Template Verb property was not matched.
 template Verb:
   http://foo.org/verb
 statement Verb:
   http://example.com/xapi/verbs#sent-a-statement

Template rule was not followed:
  {:location "$.actor.member[*].name",
   :presence "included",
   :any ["Will Hoyt" "Milt Reder" "John Newman"],
   :none ["Shelly Blake-Plock" "Brit Keller" "Mike Anthony"]}
 failed: some evaluated values must be matchable
 statement values:
   no values found at location

-----------------------------
Total errors found: 2
```

The above error message indicates that the Statement's Verb property has an incorrect ID and does not match the rule (which requires that the Statement have a name property for its actor members).

### Validation on Pattern

Each Pattern is essentially a regular expression on Statement Templates, which can be composed from other Patterns. Internally, after compilation with `profile->fsms`, each Pattern is implemented as a finite state machine (FSM), which is mathematically equivalent to regular expressions.

There are five different types of Patterns, based on which of the five following properties they have. The `sequence` and `alternates` properties are arrays of identifiers, while `zeroOrMore`, `oneOrMore` and `optional` give a map of a single identifier. The following description are taken from the [Profile section of the Profile spec](https://github.com/adlnet/xapi-profiles/blob/master/xapi-profiles-structure.md#patterns):

- `sequence`: The Pattern matches if the Patterns or Templates in the array match in the order listed. Equivalent to the concatenation operation in a regex.

- `alternates`: The Pattern matches if any of the Templates or Patterns in the array match. Equivalent to the union operator (`|` in a regex string).

- `zeroOrMore`: The Pattern matches if the Template or Pattern matches one or more times, or is not matched against at all. Equivalent of the Kleene Star operation (`\*` in a regex string).

- `oneOrMore`: The Pattern matches if the Template or Pattern matches at least one time. Equivalent of the `+` operator in a regex.

- `optional`: The Pattern matches if the Template or Pattern matches exactly once, or not at all. Equivalent of the `?` operator in a regex.

Using `match-statement-vs-profile`, a compiled Profile can read a stream of Statements, where each call to `match-statement-vs-profile` returns a map between Statement registration values and a map representing the current state info for each registration. In turn, each per-registration state info data is a map from Pattern IDs to per-Pattern state info. Each per-Pattern state info map has the following fields:

- `:states` - The states that the FSM aer currently at. If `:states` is an empty set, then the FSM cannot read additional states anymore, so the Statement stream fails to conform to the Pattern.

- `:accepted?` - Whether the current state is an accept state; this indicates that the stream of Statements was accepted by the Pattern (though more Patterns may be read in).

That per-Pattern state info map is the return value for `match-statement-vs-pattern`, which is designed to be used with single Patterns instead of a whole Profile.

If the state info map is `nil`, then `match-statement-vs-pattern` will begin at the start state of the FSM. If `:states` is empty, then  `match-statement-vs-pattern` will return the same map, since it cannot read any more states; otherwise, it returns an updated map with a new `:state` value.

`match-statement-vs-profile` attempts to call `match-statement-vs-pattern` on each compiled Pattern in the Pattern map. If a sequence of Statements with different registrations is passed to `match-statement-vs-profile`, then each set of same-registration Patterns is treated as its own stream, hence the need for a mapping between registrations and state info.

For more information about the technical implementation details (including  about the composition, determinization, and minimization of FSMs), check out the internal documentation, especially in the `utils/fsm` namespace. It is recommended that you also read up on the mathematical theory behind FSMs via Wikipedia and other resources; important concepts include deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata, Thompson's Algorithm for NFA composition, the powerset construction for NFA to DFA conversion, and Brzozowski's algorithm for DFA minimization.

### What about Concepts?

While Concepts are an integral part of most xAPI profiles, this library does not concern itself with them. This library is strictly focused on structural validation using Statement Templates and Patterns and not on any ontological meaning given by Concepts. In other words, this is a syntax library, not a semantics library.

## TODO

- Deal with profile-external Templates and Patterns (requires a triple store)
    - Deal with StatementRef properties.
- Deal with subtleties of reading Statements:
    - Statements MUST be read in timestamp order.
    - Statements have additional grouping requirements given by the`subregistration` property.
- Squish bugs (see Issue tracker).
